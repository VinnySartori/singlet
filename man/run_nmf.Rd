\usage{
run_nmf(
  A,
  rank,
  tol = 1e-04,
  maxit = 100,
  verbose = TRUE,
  L1 = 0.01,

}
\arguments{
\item{A}{sparse matrix (ideally variance-stabilized) of data for genes x cells (rows x columns)}

\item{rank}{factorization rank}

\item{tol}{tolerance of the fit (1e-5 for publication quality, 1e-3 for cross-validation)}

\item{maxit}{maximum number of iterations}

\item{verbose}{verbosity level}

\item{L1}{L1/LASSO penalty to increase sparsity of model}

\item{L2}{L2/Ridge penalty to increase angles between factors}

\item{threads}{number of threads for parallelization across CPUs, 0 = use all available threads}
}
